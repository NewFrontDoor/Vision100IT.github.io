It&#39;s looking more and more like a sunk cost and it doesn&#39;t show up in google anyway. The effort to get something professional up and running just seems too much amidst the weekly sermons and pastoral care.

Your web dev experience extends to your MySpace page back in 2005 where you successfully copy-pasted some html code you found online, and now you&#39;ve landed the job of dragging your church into the brave new world of Facebook, Instagram, Content Management and Responsive Design. Your pastor sent you a link to awesome_church.com and wants a site just like it.

Currently your site&#39;s up-time solely depends on the computer you have in your spare room being permanently connected to the outside world, but you&#39;re moving house in a week and it&#39;ll be down until a port becomes available in your new local DSLAM.

It&#39;s looking more and more like a sunk cost and it doesn&#39;t show up in google anyway. The effort to get something professional up and running just seems too much amidst the weekly sermons and pastoral care.

Your web dev experience extends to your MySpace page back in 2005 where you successfully copy-pasted some html code you found online, and now you&#39;ve landed the job of dragging your church into the brave new world of Facebook, Instagram, Content Management and Responsive Design. Your pastor sent you a link to awesome_church.com and wants a site just like it.

Currently your site&#39;s up-time solely depends on the computer you have in your spare room being permanently connected to the outside world, but you&#39;re moving house in a week and it&#39;ll be down until a port becomes available in your new local DSLAM.
