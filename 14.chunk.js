module.exports = "---\ntitle: Consultation\n---\n\nThe purpose of Vision 100 IT Training and Consultancy is to provide\ntailored help to ministry leaders and/or ministry admins using IT in the\nservice of the mission of their ministry. We long to help ministries\nbecome efficient and effective by doing things in the clearest, easiest\nand fastest way possible.\n\n### Who is Vision 100 IT for?\n\n-   Vision 100 IT is part of The Vision 100 Network, a Reformed\n    evangelical church planting network in Tasmania.\n-   We serve churches from a range of networks: Presbyterian, Christian\n    Reformed Church, Baptist, FIEC, Anglican.\n-   We require agreement to our simple doctrinal basis from our clients:\n    ‘http://vision100.org/beliefs’\n-   Our main area of focus is small and medium sized churches (under\n    400 people). However we have knowledge and skills to assist larger\n    churches too.\n\nConsultation and training framework\n-----------------------------------\n\nFor some churches, it can simply be more efficient and effective to have\nsomeone on the ground with you as you transition through IT changes.\nMeeting with your key staff, stakeholders and your local IT overseer\n(from within your church) can make sure that you hit the ground running.\n\nVision 100 IT offers on-site consultancy anywhere in the country, with\nthe following time commitments:\n\n-   Initial meeting to clarify needs and expectations (1 hour)\n-   3 day on-site visit\n-   Post-visit report\n-   3 post-visit coaching meetings (1 hour each)\n\nFor some churches, onsite is not possible, or is cost prohibitive - but\nyou’d still like your staff to meet virtually with Vision 100 IT to\nensure that the new tools and expectations are clearly understood.\n\nVision 100 IT can offer virtual consultancy anywhere in the country,\nwith the following time commitments:\n\n-   Initial meeting to clarify needs and expectations (1 hour)\n-   6 coaching sessions (1 hour each)\n-   For smaller churches, smaller parachurch ministries (under 50 adults\n    average attendance) and for church plants we can negotiate a lower\n    consultancy fee.\n\n### Our consultancy process\n\nIn our initial conversation, we seek to discover the context, history,\nfelt needs and existing strategies of the ministry.\n\nAfter this initial conversation we cover the following areas, with a\nfocus on those which are most significant:\n-   **Information flow:** the way that information is gathered, updated,\n    shared and erased within the ministry. This also includes attention\n    to conformity with the Australian Privacy Principles and any\n    denominational privacy policies.\n-   **Alignment:** the way IT is being used works with rather than\n    against your philosophy of ministry, strategy and\n    ministry structures.\n-   **Integration:** all your IT and other tools working together in the\n    most efficient and effective way. Removing any unnecessary steps,\n    improving automation.\n-   **Training and management processes:** how volunteers and staff are\n    equipped to use IT tools and helped over time to continue to use\n    them well.\n-   **Feature maximisation:** using IT solutions to get the best\n    possible advantages from them. Discovering features that are not yet\n    being used to their full capacity, using features correctly,\n    avoiding unnecessary features.\n-   **Communications plan:** how is vision and practical information\n    communicated clearly and consistently to staff, leaders, volunteers,\n    members and outsiders?\n-   **Updating and assessing:** setting to keep new patterns working\n    well, and planning to regularly assess and improve.\n\n### Community tools and events\n\nA vital supplement to tailored consultancy is the broader collection of\ntools and events that support ministries in their efforts to use IT for\nthe cause of the gospel.\n\nWe have a range of documentation, blog posts and other social media\ninput to keep ministries growing and developing.\n\nWe also run training events, podcasts and webinars to provide input on\ngeneral areas of need.\n\nOur community tools also put ministries in touch with others who are\nalso working at similar challenges, so that they can learn from one\nanother.\n\nPricing\n-------\n\nOur on-site consultancy carries a cost of $2500. This is all-inclusive\ncost, covering all travel, accommodation and food for the duration of\nthe agreed consultation period.\n\nExtra travel surplus would be required for Darwin, Perth, north of\nBrisbane, regional areas and outside Australia. This will be priced on\nenquiry.\n\nOur virtual consultancy carries a cost of $750 for the duration of the\nagreed consultancy.\n\nFor smaller churches, smaller parachurch ministries (under 50 adults\naverage attendance) and for church plants we can negotiate a lower\nconsultancy fee.\n"
