Stages have an indicative time attached to them; this obviously depends on the responsiveness of our clients. Consider these times the amount of time we need to work on these items, assuming no delay from waiting on images/logos and things like that.\n\n***\n\nStage 1: Project Setup\n---------------\n*Indicative length: 3-6 weeks* - The purpose here is to get as much information from clients as they have.  Things like existing assets (images, content) and logos are setup. These steps aren’t generally done in order, but all steps will be complete before moving on.\n### Template and Logo Selection\n*(Vision 100 IT and Client)*\n1. Generally, Vision 100 IT will provide some guidance on templates that a client can choose.  Churches/ministries can choose any template they like, but it often works better to provide them with options to show what’s possible, and also to showcase our existing work.\n2. While we generally work with existing pre-fabricated templates, if churches have a graphic designer, either in-house or contracted, we are also able to work with them to produce the website look and feel.\n\n### Domain Selection, if necessary\n*(Client)*\n1.\tVision 100 IT will offer suggestions, but the choice is ultimately up to the church/ministry.  Vision 100 IT can help with determining what names are available.\n\n### Domain Registration, if necessary\n*(Vision 100 IT)*\n1.\tThis could involve registering a new domain to add to our existing portfolio, or handing over management of an existing domain to Vision 100, if that is the church’s preference.\n\n### Website Setup\n*(Vision 100 IT)*\n1. Vision 100 will set up a placeholder website which will either become the placeholder page, or become the new website once it is fully developed.  Usually, the address of the website is something like new.churchname.org (ie. new.crckingston.org.au) to allow the existing website to work uninterrupted.\n\n### Placeholder Page, if necessary\n*(Vision 100 IT)*\n1. This step is only necessary for churches/ministries that do not have an existing website, or whose existing websites are unsuitable for that church/ministry.  The aim is to give our churches/ministries something functional as early as possible, allow them to start uploading sermons and entering events.\n2. Vision 100 have a mock-up of this placeholder page, but it will contain:\n\t*\tChurch Logo\n\t*\tNew website message, including some form of “We’re working on it” message and expected date for new website\n\t*\tLatest Sermon (download, stream from site)\n\t*\tWhat’s on (list of next x number of events, usually 3 to 5)\n\t*\tWhere We Are (including embedded Google map)\n\t*\t Footer with church logo and Vision 100 IT logo\n\nStage 2: Iterative Website Implementation\n---------------\n*Indicative Length: 8-16 weeks* - Website implementation of Vision 100 IT websites involves simultaneous implementation of the look and feel (as determined by logo and template selection from Stage 1), and implementing and customising our standard website features, as well as any other new features required by a church’s website.\n\n### 1. Website Look and Feel\n*(Vision 100 IT and Client)*\n1. This is a back and forth process, often between Vision 100 IT and graphic designer or church/ministry leader.\n2. We aim to make all progress visible to the client, so that we can get feedback regularly on how the website is looking.\n3. During this process, we often require things like images/sermon series banners/sample sermons so we can test how things look with real website data.\n4. We will also work to make the website responsive (work well on desktops as well as phones/tablets) during this process, which often means getting new images/adjusting quality of your current ones.\n\n### 2. Website Features\n1. Our approach to developing websites is to implement each feature one at a time. Initially, we’ll implement the solution that we’ve developed as best practice with our other churches. This means you’ll get a mature implementation of the feature to begin with, with subsequent refinement, either in features or in the way things look, in due course.\n2. Our features/modules, as of April 2016, are:\n\t*\tSermons\n\t\t1.\tCovers uploading sermons, presenting them in sermon series, inclusion of study notes, showing latest sermon and sermon series on the front page, podcasting to iTunes or other subscription services, and can include linking to video recordings of those sermons using services like YouTube or Vimeo.\n\t*\tEvents\n\t\t1.\tIncludes maintaining a website calendar, but also an approach to a “What’s On” page that recognises the difference between what newcomers need when they visit church websites, and what visitors need to know.\n\t\t2.\tAlso can include things like church management system integration for services and community events if a church is running a system like Church Community Builder (CCB) or Elvanto.\n\t\t3.\tHandles “What’s coming up” on the front page, as well as iCal integration to allow users to add the church calendar to their phone/calendar application.\n\t*\tEvent Registration\n\t\t1.\tUsually developed on an as needs basis for things like Camp/Conference Registration.\n\t\t2.\tIncludes options to pay via Paypal/Direct Deposit\n\t\t3.\tAutomatic confirmation emails sent to registrants\n\t\t3.\tVision 100 IT charges a nominal fee per event with a hard limit each year.\n\t*\tAbout and Contact Us Pages\n\t*\tPublished Documents\n\t\t1.\tCovers things like newsletters, rosters and other documents that churches often need published on their website.\n\t*\tBasic Elvanto integration\n\t\t1.\tIncludes directing users to Elvanto login from website login.\n\t\t2.\tA web form so current members can update their contact details, or new members can provide their details online.\n\t\t3.\tElvanto calendar integrated to the Events module (for a single 'source of truth')\n\nStage 3: Website Content Addition and Launch\n---------------\n*Indicative Length: 4-8 weeks* - This stage involves setting up a process to migrate content from existing websites, or for church users to add information to ensure the website is populated with content when it is launched.\n\n### Migrating data from existing website\n*(Vision 100 IT)*\n*\tWhere available, Vision 100 IT can migrate existing sermons and events from the previous website, if one existed.\n*\tGenerally, it’s only necessary to migrate this data.\n\n### Fleshing out website content\n*(Client)*\n*\tWith our guidance, we’ll ensure that all necessary information has been filled out to make the launch a success.\n\n### Launch plan\n*(Vision 100 IT and Client)*\n*\tVision 100 IT will assist with this to make sure that the site launch is handled in a way that ensures that all relevant users are notified, and provide guidelines to ensure the website content is kept up to date and feels “alive”.\n"},1220:function(e,t){e.exports="---\r\ntitle: Keeping Kids Safe on the Internet\r\nsub_title: Training Night Resources\r\n---\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n------\r\nKeeping Kids safe on the Internet was a Vision 100 IT Training night run in November 2016, where we tried to help parents, pastors and ministry workers think about the kind of culture you need to create to keep kids safe on the internet.

All the people who need access to documents can have access to up-to-date versions. And whenever the make a change, everyone else will get it straight away.\n\nA great advantage of SparkleShare is that because it is free software, there is no storage limit, and therefore users or churches don't have to start paying a fee when they pass a certain point.\n\nAnother advantage of SparkleShare over other cloud storage solutions is that the documents are stored under the church's name, rather than the individual who set it up.\n\n### Difference between SparkleShare and other similar software\nThe key difference in understanding SparkleShare, is that it is halfway between a Shared Drive and Dropbox. Shared Drive is an entire filing system owned by the organisation, allowing individuals to access each individual folder they have permission to. Dropbox is a group of personal filing systems, each which can be shared individually.\n\nSparkleShare is a group of filing systems, each having their own permissions. You can't have separate permissions for the sub-folders of a project. Giving a user access to a folder gives them access to all that folders contents. So a user will end up haveing to have several folders.\n\nThe name for these separate folders are 'projects' (technical name is 'repository', or 'repos' for short).\n\nStructuring your projects\n---------------\n\n### Project / Repositories\nProjects/Repositories are defined after the users in the gitolite.conf file. Repositories are the folders users will access through SparkleShare. Repositories are referred to as Projects in SparkleShare. Repositories can be defined individually or in groups.\n\nOnce created, a repository can not be renamed or deleted using the gitolite.conf file.  To have a repository renamed or deleted, please contact Vision 100. Renaming a repository after it has been defined is not recommended as all users will need to download the newly named repository.\n\n*Repositories define who has access and the permissions they will have when accessing the repository.*\n\n### Structure\nThe two principles with setting up the number of Projects are:\n1. **Security**: what needs to be kept separate based on privacy\n2. **Convenience**: you want everyone to have as much access as they need, without having heaps more than they need\n\nCategories of projects can be:\n1.\t**Admin**: A SparkleShare permissions admin repo, a Staff admin repo (for things like Human Resources – notes on staff)\n2.\t**Leadership**: Repos for Staff and for Student Leaders (a mix of private stuff and stuff that people only need access to if they are staff/student leader)\n3.\t**Departments**: Separate repos for the main, large 'Departments' - Events, Fellowship Groups, Evangelism, Finance (including Fundraising), HQ (including branding and IT).\n4.\t**General**: general documents and procedure that everyone should have access – such as general templates, general ministry vision and values, etc\n5.\tThese separate repos will need to have **'Procedure'** folders in each of them.\n\nThis leads to about 12 'repos' for a church of 100 people. It shouldn't be made so granular that you have 'Band' and 'AV' - better for some people to have a lot more than they need, rather than to multiply Projects endlessly.\n\n### Project Names\nProject/Repo names can't contain spaces.\n\nSince many users might end up having access to repositories from multiple organisations, it is helpful to use prefixes for repository names. For example, if someone has access to Vision 100, Uni Fellowship and Crossroads repositories, and each organisation has a “Staff” repository, it would be beneficial for each organisation to use a prefix: V100Staff, UFCStaff, CrossroadsStaff.\n\nAdd a New User\n---------------\n### Give Them Basic Training and User Guidelines\n* Require all new users need to be asked to carefully read the Guidelines for SparkleShare Users.doc. Give all new users basic training, reinforcing the key points in this document.\n* Once it is set up, SparkleShare is very easy to use – it's just like any other folder on your computer.\n* However, some users might find getting started a bit intimidating and will need help.\n* Also, there are some mistakes that can cause trouble if users aren't warned about them.\n* In our experience it is quickest and easiest to help people get set up face to face.\n\n### Keys\nWhen a new user installs SparkleShare on their computer, SparkleShare automatically generates a 'key' for that user. That key can be found by opening the SparkleShare menu and selecting 'Copy to Clipboard' under 'Client ID'.\nIn order to give a user access to Crossroads SparkleShare projects they must give us their key, and we need to add their key to the appropriate back-end files.\n\n### Checklist\n*\tInstruct the new user in how to install SparkleShare on their computer.\n*\tAsk them to send a copy of the SparkleShare key (via email) to you (the administrator).\n*\tRename that file as follows: '[FirstnameSurname].pub'\n    * No spaces allowed. And it doesn't have to match their Username (which may include spaces)\n    * Make sure no extra spaces or lines get added to the document when you cut and paste the key. This can happen by accidentally copy and pasting more than just the text of the key itself.\n* Make sure it is Plain Text, not Rich Text Format – In the text editing program, select Format –> Make Plain Text.\n* Change the file extension to '.pub':\n    * Mac – With the file selected, press Command + I. The information panel allows you to change the file extension.\n    * Windows – In Control Panel, open Folder Options. On the View tab, un-tick “Hide extensions for known file types”. When renaming the key file, you can now edit the file extension.\n* Move that .pub file into the following folder:\n    * SparkleShare/<organisation>-admin/keydir/\n* Add their [FirstnameSurname] to the appropriate places in the gitolite.conf file (see Section 4, below)\n\n### Special Case: Multiple Installs by an Individual User\nWhen a user installs SparkleShare on a second computer (or third, or fourth), they will receive a unique key for those installations, and those unique keys must be captured in the back-end before they can access the projects on that computer.\nBut for the administrator, there's a problem: you can't have two [FirstnameSurname].pub files with exactly the same filename in the /keydir folder. So here's the workaround:\n* As above, get them to email their link code file to you.\n* Rename it, as above.\n* Move this second file into ~/keydir/second\n * This means there will be two identically named files. One in /keydir/, and one in /keydir/second/.\n*Note: so long as the filenames are indeed identical, there is no need to adjust gitolite.conf.*\n\nGiving Permissions\n---------------\n\n### Gitolite Configuration\nFound in /<folder-admin>/conf/, the gitolite.conf file contains all the information needed to manage projects and user permissions in SparkleShare. This is a regular text file that can be opened in any text editor, like notepad or textedit.\n\n### Users\nIn the gitolite.conf file, users are typically defined in groups at the beginning of the file. If a user doesn't fit a specific group, they can be assigned to each repository they need access to.\nThe name of the user is defined by the name of their public key file, found in the keys directory. This must match exactly for them to gain access. For example, the public key is called HenryJackson.pub and in the gitolite.conf, the user is HenryJackson.\n\n### Groups\nGroups can be used to reference groups of users or repositories using the following notation\n*\t@staff = Marilyn Kathryn Billy Henry\n    The users Marilyn, Kathryn, Billy, and Henry can be referenced using @staff\n*\t@general = Procedure Ministries\n    The repositories Procedure and Ministries can be reference using @general\n    Groups can also be used in the definition of other groups\n*\t@teamleaders = @staff Lois Carl\n    The users Lois and Carl and the users in @staff (Marilyn, Kathryn, Billy, and Henry) can all be referenced using @teamleaders\n    @all is a special group name that is can be used to mean \"all users\" or “all repos\".\n    Comments can be added to the gitolite.conf file for readability using the # character\n*\t#This line will be a comment because it starts with the hash character\n\n### Permissions\nPermissions can only be added to a whole Project, not to sub-folders. If you need more restricted permissions, you will need a separate project for that purpose.\n* R, for read only\n*\tRW, for read and write\n*\tRW+,  for read, write and deletion\n\n### Example of a gitolite.conf\n\t#User definition\n\t@staff = Marilyn Kathryn Billy Henry\n\t@teams = @staff Lois Carl\n\t#Staff workspace reposity\n\trepo StaffWorkspace\n\t\tRW+\t= @staff\n\t#Team workspace reposity\n\trepo TeamWorkspace\n\t\tRW+\t= @teams\n\t#Henry's personal repository\n\trepo Henry\n\t\tRW+\t= @Henry\n\t#All other repositories everyone has read access\n\trepo Procedure Ministries\n\t\tRW+\t= @staff\n\t\tR\t= @all\n"},1224:function(e,t){e.exports="---\ntitle: Vision 100 IT Tool suite\nsub_title: A summary of all current (and grandfathered) tools utilised by Vision 100 IT\n---\n\nSummary\n-------\nThe following is a list of tools used by Vision 100 IT in order to serve our client churches and ministry organisations.\n\n***\n\nCurrent tools\n---------------\n\n1.
